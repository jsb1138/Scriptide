# Scriptide

Scriptide is an all-in-one solution for video conferencing, realtime IDE collaboration, note taking and whiteboarding. Scriptide allows for teams of up to 250 users to meet, as well as enter and run code all from the comfort of a single, platform agnostic desktop application. Designed primarily for educational purposes, Scriptide gives educators a simple to use platform to host and manage realtime lessons with students in an engaging and streamlined environment. Instructors can offer or revoke students' ability to contribute to the shared IDE as well as manage their microphones from a simple to use interface. Students may signal the instructor their interest in contributing with a simple hand-raise mechanic.

## Getting Started

In order to run Scriptide, users can clone this repository and then run:

### `npm i`

Which installs all of the app's dependencies.

### `npm run tauri dev`

Will run the app locally in your default browser.

### `npm run tauri build`

Builds the app for production to a local `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles the app in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Tech Stack

Scriptide is written with the React frontend framework and Typescript and is bundled using Tauri, which relies on Rust. Tauri delivers application builds with platform native functionality for Mac OS, Windows and Linux. Scriptide employs AWS Chime and Amplify for its video conferencing capabilities. It utilizes the Monaco Editor and Judge0 for its code input and execution capabilites. The app uses Liveblocks to enable end-to-end multiplayer functionality and the app relies on AWS Lambda and DynamoDB to manage and deliver backend services.
